## How to host your bot?

### Requirements

* A valid [Telegram Bot API token](https://core.telegram.org/bots/tutorial#obtain-your-bot-token).

### Run with Docker

1. **Create your own `.env`:** Copy the template and edit it with your own information. The template contains useful examples.

    ```sh
    cp example.env .env
    ```

2. **Build docker image:** Build the docker image in the repo root path.

    ```sh
    docker build -t settleexpensesbot-img .
    ```

3. **Run the docker container:** Run a container with the built image, mounting a volume to the current folder (to store data snapshots and logs) and defining the path of your `.env` file. 

    ```sh
    docker run -d \
        --name settleexpensesbot-container \
        -v ./:/app/data \
        --env-file .env \
        --restart always \
        settleexpensesbot-img
    ```

### Run with Go (for debug)

* **Run the bot**: Run the go command to start your bot defining the log level, the Telegram API token and the admin usernames and aliases.

    ```sh
    LOG_LEVEL=debug TELEGRAM_TOKEN=123456789:ABCDEF ADMIN_USER_IDS=11111 ADMIN_USER_ALIASES=super-dev go run ./cmd/bot
    ```
